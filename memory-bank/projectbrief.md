# Project Brief: Grace Electrical System Upgrade

## Project Overview
This project documents the upgrade of Grace's marine electrical system from traditional AGM batteries to newer lithium battery technology, along with the addition of monitoring systems to track battery health and an inverter for AC power when off the dock.

## Core Requirements
1. Document the existing (2024) electrical setup with AGM batteries
2. Detail the 2025 electrical upgrade to lithium battery technology
3. Explain the battery selection process and comparison between AGM and LiFePO4 technologies
4. Provide comprehensive diagrams and specifications for both systems

## Project Goals
- Create clear documentation of both the old and new electrical systems
- Explain the motivation and benefits of upgrading to lithium battery technology
- Detail the selection criteria for the new battery components
- Provide a reference for future maintenance and potential further upgrades

## Project Scope
- Documentation of the 2024 electrical system configuration
- Documentation of the 2025 electrical system upgrade
- Comparison of battery technologies and selection process
- Diagrams and specifications for all components in both systems
