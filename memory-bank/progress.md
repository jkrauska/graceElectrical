# Progress: Grace Electrical System Documentation

## What Works
1. **Memory Bank Structure**: Created the core memory bank files for the project:
   - projectbrief.md
   - productContext.md
   - systemPatterns.md
   - techContext.md
   - activeContext.md
   - progress.md (this file)

2. **Existing Documentation**: The current README.md contains:
   - Detailed Mermaid diagram of the 2025 electrical system
   - Component descriptions for the new system
   - Wiring specifications
   - Power flow explanations

## What's Left to Build
1. **README.md Update**: Restructure to serve as an overview with:
   - Introduction to the project
   - Motivation for the upgrade
   - Navigation links to detailed pages
   - Brief comparison of old vs. new systems

2. **2024 Electrical System Documentation**:
   - Create 2024-electrical-system.md
   - Document the previous AGM battery setup
   - Create diagram of the old system
   - Detail components and specifications

3. **2025 Electrical Upgrade Documentation**:
   - Create 2025-electrical-upgrade.md
   - Move detailed content from current README.md
   - Ensure all components are properly documented

4. **Battery Selection Documentation**:
   - Create battery-selection.md
   - Compare AGM and LiFePO4 technologies
   - Detail selection criteria and decision process
   - Include size and capacity considerations

## Current Status
- Memory bank structure established
- Plan for documentation restructuring created
- Ready to implement documentation changes

## Known Issues
- No current issues identified

## Evolution of Project Decisions
1. **Initial Documentation Approach**:
   - Started with a single README.md containing all information
   - Focused primarily on the new (2025) system

2. **Expanded Documentation Scope**:
   - Decided to document both old and new systems for comparison
   - Added focus on the motivation and selection process

3. **Restructured Documentation Format**:
   - Moved to a multi-file approach for better organization
   - Created a memory bank for comprehensive project documentation

4. **Enhanced Content Focus**:
   - Added emphasis on the battery selection process
   - Included more context about the motivation for the upgrade
