# Progress: Grace Electrical System Documentation

## What Works
1. **Memory Bank Structure**: Created the core memory bank files for the project:
   - projectbrief.md
   - productContext.md
   - systemPatterns.md
   - techContext.md
   - activeContext.md
   - progress.md (this file)

2. **Documentation Structure**: Created a comprehensive documentation structure:
   - README.md (overview with links to detailed pages)
   - 2024-electrical-system.md (previous AGM setup)
   - 2025-electrical-upgrade.md (new lithium system)
   - battery-selection.md (comparison and selection process)
   - wiring-sizing-cheatsheet.md (reference for marine wiring)

3. **Component Documentation**: Added detailed specifications for:
   - LiTime 12V 230Ah LiFePO4 battery ($430)
   - West Marine Group 4D AGM batteries ($890 each)
   - Victron Energy MultiPlus inverter/charger ($480)
   - Victron SmartShunt battery monitors ($72 each)

## What's Left to Build
1. **Additional Reference Materials**: Potential additional documentation that could be created:
   - Maintenance schedule and procedures
   - Troubleshooting guide
   - Installation documentation with photos
   - Performance data and runtime calculations

2. **System Expansion Documentation**:
   - Guidelines for adding additional components
   - Solar integration possibilities
   - Alternative charging options

## Current Status
- Memory bank structure established
- Core documentation completed
- Component specifications and costs documented
- Wiring reference guide created

## Known Issues
- No current issues identified

## Evolution of Project Decisions
1. **Initial Documentation Approach**:
   - Started with a single README.md containing all information
   - Focused primarily on the new (2025) system

2. **Expanded Documentation Scope**:
   - Decided to document both old and new systems for comparison
   - Added focus on the motivation and selection process

3. **Restructured Documentation Format**:
   - Moved to a multi-file approach for better organization
   - Created a memory bank for comprehensive project documentation

4. **Enhanced Content Focus**:
   - Added emphasis on the battery selection process
   - Included more context about the motivation for the upgrade
   - Added detailed component specifications and costs
   - Created wiring reference guide for future maintenance and upgrades
