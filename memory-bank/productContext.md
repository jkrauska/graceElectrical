# Product Context: Grace Electrical System

## Why This Project Exists
The Grace Electrical System Upgrade project exists to document the transition from traditional AGM batteries to modern lithium battery technology in a marine environment. This documentation serves as both a record of the upgrade process and a reference for future maintenance or further improvements.

## Problems It Solves
1. **Limited Power Capacity**: The previous AGM battery setup had limitations in capacity and usable power, restricting the vessel's capabilities when off the dock.
2. **Battery Lifespan Issues**: AGM batteries have shorter lifespans, especially in deep-cycle applications, leading to more frequent replacements.
3. **Lack of Monitoring**: The previous system lacked comprehensive monitoring of battery health and power consumption.
4. **Limited AC Power Availability**: Without an inverter, AC power was only available when connected to shore power.
5. **Documentation Gap**: There was a need for clear documentation of both the old and new systems for maintenance and reference purposes.

## How It Should Work
The documentation should provide:
1. Clear explanations of both the 2024 (AGM) and 2025 (Lithium) electrical systems
2. Detailed diagrams showing all components and connections
3. Comprehensive specifications for all system components
4. Explanation of the battery selection process and technology comparison
5. Easy navigation between different aspects of the documentation

## User Experience Goals
1. **Clarity**: Information should be presented clearly with minimal technical jargon or with explanations where technical terms are necessary.
2. **Completeness**: Documentation should cover all aspects of both electrical systems.
3. **Accessibility**: Information should be organized logically and be easy to find.
4. **Visual Aids**: Diagrams and visual representations should complement written explanations.
5. **Practical Value**: Documentation should be useful for practical applications like maintenance, troubleshooting, or future upgrades.
