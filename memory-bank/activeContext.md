# Active Context: Grace Electrical System Documentation

## Current Work Focus
The current focus is on enhancing and expanding the comprehensive documentation for Grace's electrical system, including:
1. Adding detailed component specifications and costs
2. Creating reference materials for maintenance and future upgrades
3. Ensuring all documentation is consistent and cross-referenced

## Recent Changes
1. Created memory bank structure with core documentation files
2. Restructured documentation into multiple focused pages:
   - README.md (overview)
   - 2024-electrical-system.md (previous AGM setup)
   - 2025-electrical-upgrade.md (new lithium system)
   - battery-selection.md (comparison and selection process)
3. Added detailed component specifications and costs:
   - LiTime 12V 230Ah LiFePO4 battery ($430)
   - West Marine Group 4D AGM batteries ($890 each)
   - Victron Energy MultiPlus inverter/charger ($480)
   - Victron SmartShunt battery monitors ($72 each)
4. Created wiring-sizing-cheatsheet.md as a reference for marine wiring

## Next Steps
1. Consider creating additional reference materials:
   - Maintenance schedule and procedures
   - Troubleshooting guide
   - Installation documentation with photos
2. Explore documentation for potential system expansions:
   - Solar integration possibilities
   - Alternative charging options

## Active Decisions and Considerations
1. **Documentation Structure**: Split documentation into multiple pages for better organization and readability
2. **Content Focus**: Emphasized the comparison between old and new systems to highlight improvements
3. **Diagram Approach**: Using Mermaid for consistent diagramming across all documentation
4. **Technical Detail Level**: Balancing technical accuracy with accessibility for different reader expertise levels
5. **Cost Documentation**: Including detailed cost information to demonstrate the economic benefits of the upgrade
6. **Reference Materials**: Creating practical reference guides like the wiring sizing cheatsheet to support maintenance and future modifications

## Important Patterns and Preferences
1. **Markdown Format**: All documentation uses Markdown for consistency and ease of maintenance
2. **Mermaid Diagrams**: System diagrams use Mermaid syntax with consistent color coding
3. **Component Categorization**: Using consistent categories for components (power sources, protection, distribution, etc.)
4. **Cross-Referencing**: Ensuring related information is linked between documents
5. **Tabular Data**: Using tables for clear comparison of specifications and costs
6. **Specification Links**: Including links to manufacturer datasheets for detailed component information

## Learnings and Project Insights
1. **Documentation Value**: Comprehensive documentation is essential for complex systems like marine electrical setups
2. **Technology Transition**: The shift from AGM to lithium represents a significant upgrade in marine electrical systems
3. **System Integration**: Understanding how components interact is crucial for effective documentation
4. **User Perspective**: Considering both technical accuracy and user accessibility in documentation
5. **Economic Benefits**: The lithium upgrade provides both immediate and long-term cost benefits, contrary to common assumptions about higher initial costs
6. **Standards Compliance**: Highlighting compliance with marine standards (like ABYC E-13) is important for safety and reliability
