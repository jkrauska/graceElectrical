# Active Context: Grace Electrical System Documentation

## Current Work Focus
The current focus is on creating comprehensive documentation for Grace's electrical system, including:
1. Restructuring the README.md to serve as an overview
2. Creating separate documentation pages for the 2024 electrical system, 2025 upgrade, and battery selection process
3. Establishing a memory bank for the project to maintain documentation standards

## Recent Changes
1. Created memory bank structure with core documentation files
2. Analyzed existing README.md content to understand the current documentation state
3. Developed a plan to restructure documentation into multiple focused pages

## Next Steps
1. Update README.md to serve as an overview with links to detailed pages
2. Create 2024-electrical-system.md documenting the previous setup
3. Create 2025-electrical-upgrade.md documenting the new system
4. Create battery-selection.md explaining the battery choice process
5. Ensure all documentation is consistent and cross-referenced

## Active Decisions and Considerations
1. **Documentation Structure**: Decided to split documentation into multiple pages for better organization and readability
2. **Content Focus**: Emphasizing the comparison between old and new systems to highlight improvements
3. **Diagram Approach**: Using Mermaid for consistent diagramming across all documentation
4. **Technical Detail Level**: Balancing technical accuracy with accessibility for different reader expertise levels

## Important Patterns and Preferences
1. **Markdown Format**: All documentation uses Markdown for consistency and ease of maintenance
2. **Mermaid Diagrams**: System diagrams use Mermaid syntax with consistent color coding
3. **Component Categorization**: Using consistent categories for components (power sources, protection, distribution, etc.)
4. **Cross-Referencing**: Ensuring related information is linked between documents

## Learnings and Project Insights
1. **Documentation Value**: Comprehensive documentation is essential for complex systems like marine electrical setups
2. **Technology Transition**: The shift from AGM to lithium represents a significant upgrade in marine electrical systems
3. **System Integration**: Understanding how components interact is crucial for effective documentation
4. **User Perspective**: Considering both technical accuracy and user accessibility in documentation
